{{w|St. Mary's County, Maryland|St. Mary's County}} {{w|St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office|Sheriff's Office}} released on Monday audio recordings of calls to the emergency phone line {{w|9-1-1|911}} made during the March 20 school shooting at {{w|Great Mills High School}} (GMHS) in [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. The sheriff's office said the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
[[File:Map of Maryland highlighting Saint Mary's County.svg|thumb|left|Map highlighting Saint Mary's County within Maryland. {{image|[[Commons:User:Dbenbenn|Dbenbenn]]}}]]
In the shooting incident at GMHS on March 20, according to St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office, Austin Wyatt Rollins, a student at the school, opened fire with a {{w|Glock}} pistol at 7:57&amp;nbsp;AM {{w|Eastern Daylight Time|local time}} (1157 {{w|UTC}}); he shot 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey in the head and also wounded another student, identified as 14-year-old Desmond Barnes, with a single shot. Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill, assigned to the school as a {{w|school resource officer}}, confronted Rollins within three minutes of the first shot. Gaskill fired at Rollins, striking his handgun just as Rollins shot himself in the head. Rollins died later at hospital.

In one of the recordings released, Desmond Barnes made a report to the emergency line, &quot;I was just shot in my school.&quot; The dispatcher replied, &quot;I'm sorry?&quot; and Barnes repeated, &quot;I was just shot at my school.&quot; The dispatcher then asked, &quot;What school are you at?&quot; and an unidentified female voice interjected, &quot;We're at Great Mills High School. Were you shot sweetie?&quot; to which Barnes responded, &quot;Yes.&quot; Barnes was released from hospital on March 21.

Jaelynn Willey initially survived her head wound. However, after two days on life support, her parents held a news conference announcing she was {{w|brain dead}} and they chose to discontinue her life support. Willey was declared dead late on the night of March 22.

The sheriff's investigators said Willey and Rollins had been in &quot;a prior relationship which recently ended&quot; and she was not a randomly selected victim.
[[File:March For Our Lives.svg|thumb|left|150px|Logo.  {{image|{{w|March For Our Lives}}}}]]
On Saturday, students from GMHS joined a wider demonstration in the United States called the &quot;{{w|March for Our Lives}}&quot; which was primarily inspired by February's {{w|Stoneman Douglas High School shooting}} in [[Florida]].

Students, alumni and teachers from GMHS traveled north to [[Washington, D.C.]] to be a part of the march. Kayla Wells, a senior student, said when speaking to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, &quot;It shouldn't happen again. It shouldn't happen to anyone[...] How did we become so desensitized to shootings happening?&quot;

Marianne Beaulieu, who has been suffering from anxiety &lt;!-- &quot;panic attacks&quot; --&gt; since the shooting, said to ''The Baltimore Sun'', &quot;I feel like I'm helping to make a change[...] We need to make Jaelynn's death the last gun violence death in our schools ever.&quot;

&quot;I think our group consisted of about 250 people,&quot; alumnus and organizer Emerson Schaeffer told {{w|WTTG}} television regarding the GMHS numbers in Washington.

&quot;We will march for you, Jaelynn Willey. We will march for all the students of Great Mills who will forever be traumatized because of what happened on Tuesday” {{w|Twitter|tweeted}} Jaclyn Corin, a student at {{w|Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School}}.

Back in {{w|Great Mills, Maryland|Great Mills}}, a coastal town in {{w|Saint Mary's County}} about 65 {{w|mile|miles}} (105 {{w|kilometre|kilometers}}) from the United States capital, there was a gathering &lt;!-- WTTG says candle light, but they show video and no candles can be seen --&gt; on Sunday in remembrance of Jaelynn Willey.

On Monday, two {{w|US Republican Party}} legislators, {{w|Greg Walden}} and {{w|Frank Pallone|Frank Pallone Jr.}}, respectively the chairman and the ranking member of the {{w|United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce}}, co-wrote a public letter to {{w|Jim Zemlin}}, executive director of The {{w|Linux Foundation}}, about {{w|open-source software}} (OSS) and improving its security.&lt;!--The Hill--&gt; They requested Zemlin to answer their questions by no later than April 16.&lt;!--Letter--&gt;

The letter contained the following four questions; each of the first two has a further two follow-up questions.&lt;!--Letter--&gt;&lt;!--ITWire--&gt;&lt;!--Could we list the questions here?--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Has the CII [{{w|Core Infrastructure Initiative}}] performed a comprehensive study of which pieces of OSS are most crucial to the &quot;global information infrastructure&quot;?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-alpha&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If not, does the CII plan to perform such a study?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What would the CII need in order to do so?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Has the CII, or any other organizations, compiled any statistics on OSS usage?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-alpha&quot;&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;If not, does the CII plan to perform such a study?&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;What would the CII need in order to do so?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;In your estimation, how sustainable and stable is the OSS ecosystem?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Based on your response to the previous question, how can the OSS ecosystem be made more sustainable and stable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Walden and Pallone exemplified {{w|Heartbleed}}, a &quot;critical cybersecurity vulnerability&quot; that allowed the hacking of websites and passwords, and millions of medical records in 2014.&lt;!--Letter--&gt;&lt;!--The Hill--&gt; They also wrote that, in response to that vulnerability, The Linux Foundation established a multi-million dollar project, the Core Infrastructure Initiative, intended to improve the global infrastucture of such software.&lt;!--ITWire--&gt;&lt;!--Letter--&gt;

The politicians noted large tech companies like {{w|Microsoft}}, {{w|Apple Inc.}}, and {{w|Adobe Systems}} respond more quickly to such critical vulnerabilities than distributors and developers of open-source software.

Open-source software is &quot;publicly accessible&quot; and usually freely-licensed for a wide range of use, such as modification and commercial uses.&lt;!--OpenSource.com--&gt; Walden and Pallone also expressed praise toward open-source software and cited a 2015 survey conducted by Black Duck Software saying 78% of companies used such software.&lt;!--Letter--&gt;

In a statement on Wednesday, Brad Banducci, the chief executive of  {{w|Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths}}, a large retail supermarket in [[Australia]], announced a plan to ban free single-use plastic bags in Woolworths stores in [[Queensland]], [[Victoria]], [[New South Wales]], and [[Western Australia]]. The ban would apply from June 20 this year, eleven days earlier than the deadline of July 1 set by some of the states' legislation.

The planned bans in the stores in Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia follow state legislation requiring the single-use bags to be banned by July 1. However, Woolworth's plan to ban single-use plastic bags in its stores in New South Wales was voluntary.

Reusable plastic bags would be sold for fifteen cents; canvas, 99 cents. 

The change reportedly would affect Woolworths supermarkets, {{W|BWS (liquor retailer)|BWS}} liquor stores, Woolworth Metro stores, and petrol stations that have shops operated by Woolworths.

Advocates of the change have cited environmental concerns. Brad Banducci said, &quot;Our teams have been working hard behind the scenes to accelerate the rollout of this plan so we can start making a positive impact on the environment as quickly as possible&quot;.

Starting from July last year, {{w|Coles Supermarkets|Coles}} and Woolworths had originally planned to phase out single-use plastic bags by June 30.

{{w|Tasmania}}, {{w|South Australia}}, {{w|Canberra}} and the {{w|Northern Territory}} were already not using single-use plastic bags following state bans, SBS reported.
