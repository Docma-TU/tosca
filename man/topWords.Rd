\title{Top Words per Topic}
\usage{
topWords(topics, numWords = 1, byScore = TRUE, epsilon = 1e-05, values = FALSE)

importance(topics, epsilon = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
\item{topics}{\code{named matrix}: 
The counts of vocabularies (column wise) in topics (row wise).}

\item{numWords}{\code{integer(1)}: 
The number of requested top words per topic.}

\item{byScore}{\code{logical(1)}: 
Should the values that are taken for determining the top words per topic be
calculated by the function \code{importance} (\code{TRUE}) or should
the absolute counts be considered (\code{FALSE})?}

\item{epsilon}{\code{numeric(1)}: 
Small number to add to logarithmic calculations to overcome the issue of
determining \code{log(0)}.}

\item{values}{\code{logical(1)}: 
Should the values that are taken for determining the top words per topic be
returned?}
}
\value{
Matrix of top words or, if \code{value} is \code{TRUE} a list of
matrices with entries \code{word} and \code{val}.
}
\description{
Determines the top words per topic as \code{\link[lda]{top.topic.words}} do.
In addition, it is possible to request the values that are taken for 
determining the top words per topic. Therefore, the function \code{importance}
is used, which also can be called independently.
